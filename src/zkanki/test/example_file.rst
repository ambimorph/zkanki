Text
----

This section is all that will show in :c1:`Anki` as the query
and must contain at least one :c2:`cloze deletion`,
represented with :c3:`reST emphasis` tags labelled as *ci*.

In terms of a Zettel,
I see it as a concise :c4:`summary`.


Extra
-----

.. raw:: html
     
     <details><summary>See More</summary>

The other fields are folded in the "See More".

Links can be made throughout this section.
If a link refers to a file that is an Anki note
it will have the form ```nid0123456789012 <filename>`_``
which renders: 
`nid0123456789012 <filename>`_

There can also be footnotes
Lorem ipsum [#f1]_ dolor sit amet ... [#f2]_.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] Text of the first footnote.
.. [#f2] Text of the second footnote.

 
.. raw:: html
